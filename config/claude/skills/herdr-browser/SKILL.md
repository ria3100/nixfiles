# herdr-browser

A real browser in its own window, controlled through CDP. The pointer moves and clicks
visibly inside the page, so the user can watch the process. It is not headless unless
you pass `--headless`.


The `herdr-browser` command is on PATH (installed from ~/nixfiles):

```bash
herdr-browser <command>
```

It uses its own Chrome profile and window, apart from the user's everyday Chrome.

## The loop

1. **Open or find the tab**
   - `open <url>` — launches the browser if needed and navigates the current tab.
   - `tabs` — list open tabs when you are not sure what is loaded.
2. **Read the page before acting**: `snapshot`
   - Returns `url`, `title` and one line per interactive element: `[e3] button "Sign in"`.
   - Refs (`e1`, `e2`…) belong to the page as it is right now.
3. **Choose by role and name**, never by guessing. If the target is not in the snapshot,
   the page changed: run `snapshot` again.
4. **Act, one step at a time**
   - `click e3`
   - `fill e4 "texto"` (focuses and sets the value)
   - `type "texto"` (types into whatever has focus)
   - `key Enter`, `key Tab`, `key Control+A`
   - `scroll down 800`
5. **Verify after every action that changes the page**
   - `get --what url`, `get --what title`, or a new `snapshot`.
   - A click that opened a menu or a navigation invalidates the old refs.
6. **Capture evidence when the user wants to see it**: `shot <file.png>`.

If more than one tab is open, address the right one with `--page <id>`.

## Rules

- **Never invent refs.** Only click or fill refs returned by the latest `snapshot`.
- **Re-snapshot after navigation, tab changes, or dialogs.**
- **Do not disable the cursor**; the visible pointer is the point.
- **Credentials:** if the page asks for a login, stop and ask the user to sign in in
  that window. Never read, type or ask for a password in chat.
- **Read-only by default.** Submit forms, publish or delete only if the user asked.
- **Refs with a frame prefix** (`f1e12`) belong to content inside an iframe, including
  out-of-process iframes. Use the ref as-is for `click` and `fill`.
- **`eval` and `get` only see the top document.** If the content lives in an iframe, use
  `snapshot` + `click`/`fill`, not `eval`.
- When you finish, report the final URL, the title, and any screenshot path.

## Useful extras

- `extensions add <dir>` registers an unpacked extension and loads it if the browser is running.
- `profile import` copies cookies and extensions from the user's Brave profile; the source
  browser must be closed. Only run it when the user asks.
- `stop` closes the controlled browser. Do not run it unless the user asks.
